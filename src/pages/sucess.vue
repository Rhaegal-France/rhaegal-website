              <p>
                The holiday season is always a critical time for retail like
                Frasers Group. In order to speed up their recruitment process,
                they implemented a solution to collect sensitive data from their
                future employees via forms. Faced with a large number of errors
                - more than 20% - they approached Rhaegal to optimize this
                functioning.

                Form4Smart: allows the automatic sending of a form to candidates
                to collect sensitive data. It is possible to specifically
                configure the format of the candidate's response fields in order
                to limit the risk of clumsy mistakes.
