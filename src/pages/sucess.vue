                The holiday season is always a critical time for retail like
                Frasers Group. In order to speed up their recruitment process,
                they implemented a solution to collect sensitive data from their
                future employees via forms. Faced with a large number of errors
                - more than 20% - they approached Rhaegal to optimize this
                functioning.

                Form4Smart: allows the automatic sending of a form to candidates
                to collect sensitive data. It is possible to specifically
                configure the format of the candidate's response fields in order
                to limit the risk of clumsy mistakes.

               In 2017, Veolia has been using Taleo for +10 years. Taleo's configuration was no longer suitable for their recruitment needs, and no one who had the technical skills to remedy this. At this time, and until 2020, Rhaegal leveraged its expertise to reposition Taleo as an asset within the recruitment processes.
